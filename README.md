A simple skill used to make a backup of the ProjectAlice folder.

Simply install it and forget it until you need it :)
 
 Backup folder will be generated in the /pi/home/AliceBackUp directory 
 and by default updated every 5 days. Triggered on the hour. 
 
 So if you install it at 3:45pm, wait 16 minutes then go look :)
