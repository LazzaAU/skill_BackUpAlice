<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>BackUp Alice Skill </span>

Nothing you need to do with this skill other than install it.

<span style="color: #00ff00;">Principle of operation:</span>

Every hour Alice will check to see if you have a backed up version of ProjectAlice.

The back up is stored in the home directory under a folder called "AliceBackUp"
The frequency of the back ups is set in the skill settings. 
Choose the amount of days between backups and click Save. 
<i>Make it a whole number and above 0</i>
 
The default value is 5. So Alice will update the backed up folder every 5 days in that case

If you want to invoke a back up you can say "back yourself up" or similar but to be honest 
that's not really necessary as she will do it automatically herself anyway.

And if your back up is current she won't do anything anyway :)
